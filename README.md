[00:11.81] You know exactly what you do
[00:16.36] You mess it up and leave it all
[00:18.98] I know I'm a wasted shadow to you
[00:23.56] So fuck me up and do it again
[00:26.95] I'll stay and I bet you knew
[00:30.73] Just walk away and let me fall
[00:33.44] I know I'm a wasted shadow to you
[00:37.91] (Just walk away and let me fall)
[00:53.91] 
[00:40.78] How am I supposed to breathe air
[00:44.34] With your poison in my blood
[00:48.19] How am I supposed to see clear
[00:51.53] When you're in motion
[01:02.03] 
[00:53.58] I will be honest, all you wanted
[00:57.41] Was to bring yourself above
[01:00.26] And now I'm six feet under
[01:02.15] And it makes me wonder if it's over now
[01:05.66] 'Cause you're breaking me down
[01:20.66] 
[01:09.72] So done with you
[01:14.05] You left me when it's hard
[01:15.54] And you're all I need
[01:17.22] This time I feel so used
[01:21.34] I'm pushing you slowly away
[01:34.84] 
[01:27.70] You know exactly what you do
[01:32.00] You mess it up and leave it all
[01:34.71] I know I'm a wasted shadow to you
[01:39.22] So fuck me up and do it again
[01:42.43] I'll stay and I bet you knew
[01:46.59] Just walk away and let me fall
[01:49.28] I know I'm a wasted shadow to you
[01:53.77] (Just walk away and let me fall)
[02:09.77] 
[01:55.85] You know what you're doing, and you do it too often
[01:59.40] I know what I'm doing too, but that's another topic
[02:03.03] Why do I fall for a feeling so toxic?
[02:06.64] Why do I call when I know I got options
[02:10.67] Break up and make up, it's fake love
[02:14.39] Can't buy the lost time you take up
[02:17.68] There's fine dimes on my line just waiting
[02:21.20] I can't save you, no, I can't save you
[02:40.20] 
[02:25.59] You know exactly what you do
[02:29.86] You mess it up and leave it all
[02:32.54] I know I'm a wasted shadow to you
[02:37.09] So fuck me up and do it again
[02:40.39] I'll stay and I bet you knew
[02:44.33] Just walk away and let me fall
[02:46.90] I know I'm a wasted shadow to you
[02:51.56] (Just walk away and let me fall)
[03:07.56] 
[02:54.39] So done with you
[02:58.67] You left me when it's hard
[03:00.29] And you're all I need
[03:01.84] This time I feel so used
[03:05.90] I'm pushing you slowly away
